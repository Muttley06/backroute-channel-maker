/**
 * How to use Auto Channel
 * This plugin is designed to help in the automatic creation and deletion of channels inside of a category channel. 
 * Auto channels that are not inside of Catrgory channels will be ignored.
 * What is an cration channel? An auto channel is a channel that when joined will create a new auto channel, then move the user into that auto channel. The new auto channel takes the permissions and settings of the creator channel it was created from allowing you to use them for many things!
 * What is an auto channel? These are the channels created by maker channels, note these will be deleted automatically when they are empty!
 * How to create a new auto channel? Inside the autoChannelLite config there is an emoji (ðŸŽ® by default) that when a channel is prefixed with it becomes an auto channel.
 * You can also give the creator of auto channels
